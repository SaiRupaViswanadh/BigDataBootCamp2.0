    "Ans:) Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.\n",
    "One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. \n",
    "This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit\n",
    "so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "1) attributes\n",
    "2) behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "A parrot is an object, as it has the following properties:\n",
    "1) name, age, color as attributes\n",
    "2) singing, dancing as behavior\n",
    "The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. \n",
    "This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is about code reuse — you factor code to minimize redundancy and program by customizing what already exists instead of changing code in place or starting from scratch."

    "Ans:) Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because ‘+’ operator is overloaded by int class and str class. You might have noticed that the same built-in operator or function shows different behavior for objects of different classes, this is called Operator Overloading. \n",
    "Consider that we have two objects which are a physical representation of a class (user-defined data type) and we have to add two objects with binary ‘+’ operator it throws an error, because compiler don’t know how to add two objects. So we define a method for an operator and that process is called operator overloading. We can overload all existing operators but we can’t create a new operator. To perform operator overloading, Python provides some special function or magic function that is automatically invoked when it is associated with that particular operator. For example, when we use + operator, the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined.\n",

    "Ans:) Here are some essential rules of Python exception handling:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Exceptions must be class objects\n",
    ">> For class exceptions, you can use try statement with an except clause which mentions a particular class.\n",
    ">> Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may display an error when an attempt is made to execute it.\n",
    ">> Errors found during execution are called exceptions, and they are not unconditionally fatal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a try: block. After the try: block, include an except: statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "Here is simple syntax of try....except...else blocks −\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "   You do your operations here;\n",
    "   ......................\n",
    "except ExceptionI:\n",
    "   If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block.\n",
    "except ExceptionII:\n",
    "   If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block.\n",
    "   ......................\n",
    "else:\n",
    "   If there is no exception then execute this block. \n",
    "Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax −\n",
    "\n",
    "A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.\n",
    "You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.\n",
    "After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.\n",
    "The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection."
